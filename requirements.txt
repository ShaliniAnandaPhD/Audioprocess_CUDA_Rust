# Requirements for Real-Time Audio Processing with Rust and CUDA

## System Requirements
- Operating System: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux
- CUDA-capable GPU
- NVIDIA drivers compatible with your CUDA version

## Software Dependencies
- Rust (latest stable version)
  Download and installation instructions: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- CUDA Toolkit (version compatible with your GPU)
  Download and installation instructions: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
- Cargo (comes with Rust installation)

## Rust Dependencies
- cpal: Cross-platform audio library
  Crate link: https://crates.io/crates/cpal
- audioprocess_cuda_rust: Custom crate for audio processing functionalities
  (Ensure this crate is included in your project's Cargo.toml)

## Installation Instructions
1. Ensure Rust and CUDA are installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ShaliniAnandaPhD/Audioprocess_CUDA_Rust.git
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd Audioprocess_CUDA_Rust
4. Compile and run the desired application:
   cd <application_directory>
   cargo run

## Troubleshooting
- Verify that you are using a CUDA-capable GPU.
- Ensure that your NVIDIA drivers and CUDA Toolkit are up to date.
- Check the Rust compiler errors for dependency issues and resolve them by following the cargo error messages.
- For audio device-related issues, verify your system's audio settings and ensure the correct input/output devices are selected.
