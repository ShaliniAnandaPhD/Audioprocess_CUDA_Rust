   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This step is only required if you plan to use the Python scripts or interact with the Rust code from Python.

### Running the Code

To run a specific module or example, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the Rust binary or Python script.

For Rust modules:
```
cd <module_directory>
cargo run --release
```

For Python scripts:
```
cd <module_directory>
python <script_name>.py
```

Make sure to replace `<module_directory>` with the actual directory name and `<script_name>` with the desired Python script.

### Example: Audio Visualization

To run the Audio Visualization module, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `audio_visualization` directory:
   ```
   cd audio_visualization
   ```
