# Real-Time Audio Processing with Rust and CUDA

## Description
This project combines the power of Rust and CUDA to create a real-time audio processing system. Leveraging Rust's safety and concurrency features alongside CUDA's parallel computing capabilities, this system aims to efficiently handle complex audio processing tasks like noise reduction, echo cancellation, and sound effects generation. It's designed to provide a high-performance solution for real-time audio applications.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- CUDA-capable GPU.
- Rust programming language.
- CUDA Toolkit.

### Installation Steps
This section will provide comprehensive instructions for setting up the development environment. It will include guidelines for installing Rust, the CUDA Toolkit, and other necessary dependencies to ensure a smooth setup process for users.

## Usage
Here, you'll find detailed instructions on how to utilize the application, including any necessary configuration steps and operational guidelines.

### Running the Application
This part will offer a step-by-step guide on launching and operating the application, tailored to assist even those unfamiliar with Rust or CUDA.

## Voice Recognition and Processing: 
Implement a system for voice recognition and processing, which could be used in smart home devices or virtual assistants. CUDA can be used for the computationally intensive tasks of voice recognition algorithms, and Rust for the application framework and handling user inputs.
