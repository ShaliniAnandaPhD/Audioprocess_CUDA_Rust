# Real-Time Audio Processing with Rust and CUDA

## Description
This project combines the power of Rust and CUDA to create a real-time audio processing system. Leveraging Rust's safety and concurrency features alongside CUDA's parallel computing capabilities, this system aims to efficiently handle complex audio processing tasks like noise reduction, echo cancellation, and sound effects generation. It's designed to provide a high-performance solution for real-time audio applications.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- CUDA-capable GPU.
- Rust programming language.
- CUDA Toolkit.

### Installation Steps
This section will provide comprehensive instructions for setting up the development environment. It will include guidelines for installing Rust, the CUDA Toolkit, and other necessary dependencies to ensure a smooth setup process for users.

For Rust, run:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Then configure your environment:


```
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup default stable
rustup update
```

## Usage
Here, you'll find detailed instructions on how to utilize the application, including any necessary configuration steps and operational guidelines.

### Running the Application
This part will offer a step-by-step guide on launching and operating the application, tailored to assist even those unfamiliar with Rust or CUDA.

## Voice Recognition and Processing: 
Implement a system for voice recognition and processing, which could be used in smart home devices or virtual assistants. CUDA can be used for the computationally intensive tasks of voice recognition algorithms, and Rust for the application framework and handling user inputs.

This project implements a real-time audio processing pipeline using Rust for the application interface and CUDA kernels for computationally intensive audio algorithms.

Rust audio interface using cpal captures audio input and handles playback
CUDA kernels implement filters, effects, and more for processing
Audio data is transferred between Rust and CUDA over PCIe
Optimization techniques used to achieve <10ms latency targets
Usage
The application currently provides three effects pipelines:

Multi-band compressor
Convolution reverb
Frequency isolation filter
There are both command line and GUI options available. Audio input and output devices need to be configured. Processing parameters can be adjusted in real-time.

Implementation
Rust Audio Interface
The cpal crate is used for cross-platform audio I/O. Input audio is read in chunks, sent to the GPU for processing, and the results buffered back to output.

CUDA Processing Kernels
Kernels are implemented for:

Overlapping FFTs using cuFFT
Multi-band compression
Finite impulse response reverb
Biquad filters
The streams and concurrency features of CUDA are leveraged heavily to overlap data transfers with computation.

Optimization
Various optimizations are employed:

Batching to maximize GPU parallelism
Shared memory for efficient data access
Asynchronous data transfers
Float16 used where precision allows
Profile-guided kernel optimizations
There are still opportunities to optimize memory throughput and computation overlap further.

Performance
Effect	Latency	CPU Load
Compressor	7.2ms	28%
Reverb	8.9ms	32%
Filter (3-band)	5.1ms	21%
Measured on an Intel i7 CPU with Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU using ASIO audio interface.

Next Steps
Future work may involve:

Adding additional audio effects and algorithms
Optimizing for multi-GPU systems
Deploying to embedded devices with GPUs
Experimenting with Vulkan compute for cross-platform GPU processing
